00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.720
You might be thinking&nbsp;why&nbsp;Eon on the first place.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.520
Let me tell you,

3
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.800
as a developer, Eon is a&nbsp;web based&nbsp;component framework

4
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.720
designed to build amazing&nbsp;cross-platform UI's.

5
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.680
It's fast, and light

6
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.040
and it provides&nbsp;all the utilities&nbsp;you need to build amazing applications.

7
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.400
Eon is not just a core,

8
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.960
right out of the box

9
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.080
there's a full library of&nbsp;UI Web Components.

10
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.840
But remember,

11
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.520
if you like so, you can also create&nbsp;your own with ease.

12
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.600
Eon has an easy learning curve, since&nbsp;it respects the DOM API

13
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.760
and has no tool dependencies.

14
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.000
This means that you or your team&nbsp;won't have to waste time learning new stuff,

15
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.160
setting up tedious&nbsp;and fatiguing environments&nbsp;and building your code.

16
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.200
Developing with Eon is a breeze.

17
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.680
In fact, it's platform independent.

18
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.920
This means that you could use it&nbsp;with your favorite technologies

19
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.160
and progressively adopted as you go,

20
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160
without the need of redesigning your workflow.

21
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.200
Listening to all what Eon has to offer might be&nbsp;too much for a single video.

22
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.000
But let me show you how easy is to get&nbsp;started doing awesome stuff with it.

23
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.040
Simply import Eon Web Components using&nbsp;the import function and its relative path.

24
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.320
Once imported, you can use them like any other HTML element

25
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.400
and immediately see the results.

26
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.040
How convenient is that!

27
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.840
Now we're going to create a custom element,&nbsp;which is divided in three parts:

28
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.840
style, structure, and logic.

29
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.680
Use the element function to declare the component.

30
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.080
Now, we can add some content to our template.

31
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.680
This could be any valid HTML.

32
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.800
In this case, we'll use just plain text.

33
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.560
Finally, we can add some style to our&nbsp;Web Component.

34
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.280
For now, we'll change its font to cyan.

35
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.360
Now, we import the custom example

36
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.840
and use it declaratively in our "body".

37
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.040
Since everything can become a component itself,

38
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.120
this is how you can split your application&nbsp;in small reusable modules.

39
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.680
Eon has very powerful interpolation engine.

40
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.040
This means that we can bind any kind&nbsp;of data to our template.

41
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.800
In this case, we'll bind text to our template&nbsp;using the curly braces and the "at" sign.

42
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.080
Eon is reactive. This means that any change made to&nbsp;its data will be reflected on the fly

43
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.120
without the need to update it manually.

44
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.160
This means that you'll have more time&nbsp;to spend on what really matters

45
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.000
instead of updating the UI.

46
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.040
Now, we can add some logic to our&nbsp;component.

47
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.960
We'll add a data property named value&nbsp;and use it in our template.

48
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.880
We will also create a function&nbsp;that will increment that value.

49
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.080
Finally, we'll call this function&nbsp;from the button&nbsp;"on click" event.

50
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.080
As you can see, each time&nbsp;I click the button the value gets incremented

51
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.600
This barely scratches the surface&nbsp;of what Eon has to offer

52
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.840
but shows how powerful it is.

53
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.960
Thanks for watching this video.

54
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.120
Remember,&nbsp;there are&nbsp;more tutorials&nbsp;on the documentation section.

55
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.120
Please, stay tuned for more updates!
