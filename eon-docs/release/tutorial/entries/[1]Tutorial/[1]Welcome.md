## What is Eon?

Eon aims to provide a solution for user interface composition through web technologies, with extensibility and customization in mind, providing a first class unified user experience, no matter what resolution, device or platform is being used. 

Unlike other view abstraction frameworks Eon is design to remain true to the DOM and strongly bound to its underlying technologies, this means is easy to pick and easy to integrate with other frameworks since it uses the the technologies you all ready know and love. 

The framework is divided into three main parts:

- eon.js - Allows component creation and defines their life-cycle.
- ui - Provides a comprehensive component library.
- theme - Contains the different styles that can be applied to components.

Other parts of the framework include:

- modules - Multiple utils for things like cache, data manipulation and communication.
- polyfill - Provides backward compatibility for older browsers.
