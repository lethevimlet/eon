# Components

## What are vComet components?

vComet components are the individual parts of what your application is composed of, providing both functionality and visuals. With vComet components you can develop an application by composing it of small parts that can be built one at a time, this foments a encapsulated and reusable architecture.

## What can I build with them?

About anything indeed, but most of them fall in one of this three categories, functional components, visual components or a mix of both.

- Functional components - components that provide logic assets, no visuals are involved. An example could be a component that handles websocket connections.

- Visual components - components that provide visual assets, no logic is needed. An example could be a component that handles layout.

- Mixed components - this are by far the most common scenario, where you would like to provide a tied relation between behaviour logic and visual elements.
An example could be a dialog.

Please note this are conceptual definitions, all components are handled in the same way by vComet.

## Advantages of composition

By splitting a complex problem such as an application in small parts or components we can tackle each of them individually, making development cleaner and faster since each part solves an specific part of the puzzle, which can be improved and reused to perfection.
